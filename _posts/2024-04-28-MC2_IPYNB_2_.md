## My Score
I got a 24/40.

## Missed Questions
| Question # | Why I missed | How I will improve |
| - | - | - |
| 3 | I didn't know that dividing an int by a double results in a double value. But even if I didn't know, I could still have gotten the right answer because casting won't even work since it casts everything. | Think harder when solving problems. |
| 5 | I didn't know that a compiler error will occur when the parameters for the constructor are the same in the parent class (String, String, Boolean) | I will study inheritance more. |
| 6 | If there is no parenthesis next to what the double is casting, it only casts that one number. | Understand casting more. |
| 7 | I read the answers wrong and I wasn't focused enough. | Be FOCUSED!!! |
| 8 | I didn't know you could assign int values to double. I also in't notice that n1 and n2 were not defined. | Read the code much more efficiently. |
| 9 | I clicked the wrong answer. | Know what choice I choose. |
| 11 | The code actually prints down to 0 because num-- is in the front. | Read the code carefully. |
| 12 | .getName() only works if it is not null, so we have to determine if object is not null using borrower != null. | Gain a deeper understanding of objects and runtime errors. |
| 13 | I forgot to take the opposite of and, which is or. | FOCUS! |
| 14 | Because of the return statements, the other if statements are not used. | Look through the code carefully. |
| 15 | I clicked the wrong one (I think), or I forgot that the end for Math.random is not inclusive. | Look at code carefully. |
| 16 | I didn't really understand what the code was doing. | Look through the code carefully and try to make an educated guess if I don't know anything. |
| 25 | Since the loop starts from length - 1, the e from the apple is not included in the new string. | Focus on the loops and their bounds. |
| 31 | The variable i in the choice 3 is the actual element, not the index. | Focus on the code. |
| 39 | I found it hard to follow this code and I just guessed. Partially, I didn't know what compareTo returned. | Focus on the code and remember what compareTo returns. |
| 40 | If the message method is removed from class A, the parent class, there will be a compile error because the obj1 is defined as an object of Type A, and therefore needs a method from its class. | Remember that even though obj1 still returns the message method from Class B, it still needs the Class A. |

## Reflection
This exam was quite disappointing for me because I did really bad. But, by looking at similar problems over and over again, I am learning the different problem types and their solutions. I am confident that I will get better, I just hope it is enough to get a 5 on the exam.
