## My Score
I got a 56/66, which is roughly a 34/40.

## Missed Questions
| Question # | Why I missed | How I will improve |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | I didn't know that dividing an int by a double results in a double value. But even if I didn't know, I could still have gotten the right answer because casting won't even work since it casts everything. | Think harder when solving problems. |
| 5 | I didn't know that a compiler error will occur when the parameters for the constructor are the same in the parent class (String, String, Boolean) | I will study inheritance more. |
| 7 | If there is no parenthesis next to what the double is casting, it only casts that one number. | Understand casting more. |
| 9 | I read the answers wrong and I wasn't focused enough. | Be FOCUSED!!! |
| 10 | I didn't know you could assign int values to double. I also in't notice that n1 and n2 were not defined. | Read the code much more efficiently. |
| 22 | I clicked the wrong answer. | Know what choice I choose. |
| 32 | The code actually prints down to 0 because num-- is in the front. | Read the code carefully. |
| 40 | .getName() only works if it is not null, so we have to determine if object is not null using borrower != null. | Gain a deeper understanding of objects and runtime errors. |
| 47 | I forgot to take the opposite of and, which is or. | FOCUS! |
| 60 | Because of the return statements, the other if statements are not used. | Look through the code carefully. |

## Reflection
This MC was the best I took so far without any Internet help (maybe 1 or 2). Since many of the MC questions are the same or similar, doing maybe 1 or 2 more timed MCs with no Internet help will guarantee at least a 30 on the real test.
