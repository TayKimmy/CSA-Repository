## Question 2
Consider a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. The hidden word contains only capital letters and has a length known to the player. A guess contains only capital letters and has the same length as the hidden word.
After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint.

| If the letter in the guess is ... | the corresponding character in the hint is |
| - | - |
| also in the same position in the hidden word | the matching letter |
| also in the hidden word, but in different position | "*" |
| not in the hidden word | "+" |

The HiddenWord class will be used to represent the hidden word in the game. The hidden word is passed to the constructor. The class contains a method, getHint, that takes a guess and produces a hint.

For example, suppose the variable puzzle is declared as follows.

HiddenWord puzzle = new HiddenWord("HARPS");

The following table shows several guesses and the hints that would be produced.

| Call to getHint | String returned |
| - | - |
| puzzle.getHint("AAAAA") | "+A+++" |
| puzzle.getHint("HELLO") | "H****" |
| puzzle.getHint("HEART") | "H*++*" |
| puzzle.getHint("HARMS") | "HAR*S" |
| puzzle.getHint("HARPS") | "HARPS" |


```java
public class HiddenWord {
    private String hiddenWord;
    public HiddenWord(String hiddenWord) {
        this.hiddenWord = hiddenWord;
    }
    public String getHint(String guess) {
        String hint = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < guess.length(); i++) {
            if (guess.charAt(i) == hiddenWord.charAt(i)) {
                hint = hint + guess.charAt(i);
            } else if (hiddenWord.indexOf(guess.charAt(i)) != -1) {
                hint = hint + "+";
            } else {
                hint = hint + "*";
            }
        }
        return hint;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HiddenWord puzzle = new HiddenWord("HARPS");
        System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("AAAAA"));
        System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HELLO"));
        System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HEART"));
        System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HARMS"));
        System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HARPS"));
    }
}
HiddenWord.main(null);
```

    +A+++
    H****
    H*++*
    HAR*S
    HARPS
