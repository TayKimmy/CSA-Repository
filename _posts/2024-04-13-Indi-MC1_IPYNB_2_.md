## Missed Questions:
| Question # | Why I missed it | How I will improve |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | I missed it because I thought that since s wasa defined using Student, it only used the Student method, not the GradStudent method. | I will make sure to review inheritance and understand when which methods are used and how to call them. |
| 5 | I got this question wrong because I didn't notice that the class Car didn't have a constructor with no parameters. | I will make sure to look at the code in detail and look especially at the different parameters in inheritance problems. |
| 9 | I didn't look at the for loops properly and I didn't realize that when i and j are both 0, it skips the statement because j is not less than i. | When there are nested for loops, I will make sure to pay special attention to the parameters and what happens as the indexes increase. |
| 15 | I didn't read the prompts properly and it just sounded like it didn't make sense. | I will make sure to read the prompts properly and culminate a deeper understanding of inheritance and its benefits. |
| 20 | I again forgot that C1 didn't have the no parameter constructor, so C2 cannot either. | Read the code in depth and look carefully at inheritance methods. |
| 21 | I just lacked knowledge on interfaces. | Study interfaces. |
| 22 | I didn't notice that the method was void, and therefore didn't return anything. It only changed the values in the array and not the integer y. | Look at code carefully. |
| 23 | I forgot that the second parameter of the .substring method is noninclusive, making me think that the loop was out of bounds. | Make sure to think properly about different methods. |
| 30 | Again, I didn't realize that when an object is defined using the parent class but uses new child class, it uses the method of the child class. | Study inheritance more. |
| 31 | I still don't really understand why. | Look over the sorts carefully and also read the question properly. |
| 36 | Again, I forgot about the inheritance using the subclass methods even when defined using the superclass method. | Relook inheritance. |
| 37 | Selection sort still does its iterations even if the array is sorted. | Study selection sort. |
| 38 | I forgot that the if loop was saying or. If either condition was true, then the code would return true. | Look at code properly. |

### My Score: 27/40

## Reflection
This was my first test where I didn't search anything up, so I was somewhat happy with how I did. Taking this test helped me realize what I need to review before the AP Exam: mainly inheritance and extensive loops.
