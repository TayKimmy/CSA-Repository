    "## Methods of SQL Injects\n",
    "There are many different ways of performing an SQL inject. Ultimately, it hinges on your knowledge of SQL syntax to game whatever query that your target has set up. Here are just some of the few strategies I've learned over the years, but you can gain addiitonal practice from doing CTF challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using keyword OR\n",
    "Essentially, this was the strategy that you saw above. The intuition behind this strategy is offering an alternate condition for a Given SQL statement to succeed, to bypass any authentication checks. Keep in mind that there might be additional query after the ineject, so we would require SQL comments like `--` to ensure our inject works properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Union \n",
    "The `UNION` keyword in SQL is often used to join two SQL statements together, more specifically, the `SELECT` statement. What this allows us to do is to get the results of two seperate SELECT statements, and can be used to give us additional info on the database's structure by writing a new command. Take the SQL statement from above:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE uuid = ... AND password='...';\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "The statement created by the server only looks for info in the `users_info` table. But with union, we can add an additional query to the end of this. For this example, I'll be performing an inject on the uuid field. The inject will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "123' UNION SELECT name, sql from sqlite_master;--\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the actual query looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE uuid ='123' UNION SELECT name, sql from sqlite_master;-- ... AND password=';\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the first select statement doesn't return anything, our union statement will select the name and schema of the database in the backend. However, this command only works for an sqlite server, as we know the name of the table to be sqlite_master, and probably won't work for any services hosted through MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql or etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Placing Limits on User Inputs\n",
    "A common, and simple strategy to use is to place restrictions on what the user can input. Much of our SQLinjects rely on adding additional SQL statements and code to execute what we wish for it to do. Some of the following tactics could work to protect against SQL Injects:\n",

    " - Principle of least privilege\n",

    "## 3 Main Types of XSS:\n",

    "**General Definition**: Occurs when the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server and served to users whenever they access the compromised page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/01/sorted-XSS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps based on the diagram:**\n",
    "1. *Perpetrator Discovers Vulnerability:*\n",
    "    - Description: The attacker, known as the perpetrator, identifies a website that has a security vulnerability, often related to inadequate input validation or output encoding.\n",
    "    - Objective: The goal is to find a weakness that allows the injection of malicious scripts into the web application.\n",
    "2. *Injection of Malicious Script:*\n",
    "    - Description: The perpetrator injects a malicious script into the vulnerable website. This script is designed to execute specific actions when loaded by visitors' browsers.\n",
    "    - Objective: The injected script is crafted to steal sensitive information, commonly session cookies, from users who visit the compromised page.\n",
    "3. *Activation of Malicious Script:*\n",
    "    - Description: Whenever a visitor accesses the perpetrated website, the injected malicious script is activated within their browser.\n",
    "    - Objective: The script executes in the context of the user's session, enabling the attacker to carry out actions on behalf of the user or extract sensitive information.\n",
    "4. *Sending Stolen Session Cookies:*\n",
    "    - Description: The malicious script, now activated during each visitor's session, collects the session cookies of the users.\n",
    "    - Objective: The stolen session cookies are sent back to the perpetrator, who can then use these cookies to impersonate the users, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** An attacker discovers that a website allows user-generated content without proper input validation. They inject a script into a comment section, and whenever other users view that comment, the malicious script executes in their browsers, stealing their session cookies. The attacker then uses these stolen session cookies to log in as the compromised users."

    "2. *User Clicks the Link and Execution in the Browser:*\n",

    "    - Description: The attacker creates a specially crafted URL containing a malicious payload, typically in the fragment part of the URL (e.g., after the # symbol).\n",
    "    - Objective: The goal is to inject malicious JavaScript code into the victim's browser.\n",
    "2. *User Opens the Link:*\n",

    "3. *Website Receives the Request:*\n",

    "    - Objective: Despite receiving the payload, the website does not directly include it in the response to the user.\n",
    "4. *Legitimate Script Execution:*\n",
    "    - Description: The website processes the request and sends a response to the user's browser. The response may include legitimate client-side scripts.\n",
    "    - Objective: The user's browser executes the legitimate scripts included in the response, causing the page to render as intended.\n",
    "5. *Execution of Malicious Script:*\n",
    "    - Description: During the legitimate script execution, the browser processes the malicious payload included in the page, leading to the execution of the attacker's injected script.\n",
    "    - Objective: The attacker's script is executed in the context of the user's session, allowing it to perform malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information.\n",
    "6. *Sensitive Information Sent to Attacker:*\n",
    "    - Description: The executed malicious script carries out actions, such as stealing user-sensitive information (ex. session cookies), which is then sent to the attacker's server.\n",

Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application framework, which was part of the Equifax's online dispute portal. The vulnerability, CVE-2017-5638, allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating the \"Content-Type\" header in an HTTP request. They sent malicious requests with special payloads, injecting SQL code into the backend database. The breach occurred because Equifax failed to patch the known vulnerability in a timely manner. Equifax fixed the issue by applying necessary security patches to eliminate the vulnerability. The breach could have been prevented with a couple of actions. First, Equifax should have applied security patches as soon as they were known, fixing any vulnerabilities. Second, Equifax could have implement firewalls, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAF), to filter HTTP traffic between the application and the Internet. Equifax could have also validated user inputs to prevent any SQL injection attacks."
