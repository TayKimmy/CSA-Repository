    "## Question 2: Iteration over 2D arrays (Unit 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a game where you need to track player scores on a 2D grid representing levels and attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Explain the concept of iteration over a 2D array in Java. Provide an example scenario where iterating over a 2D array is useful in a programming task.\n",
    "Iterating over a 2D array in Java means iterating over each element in the array, typically through nested for loops to iterate through both the rows and columns. This allows the user to access and use each element in the array. An example of a 2D Array is a gradebook, where the rows can represent students and the columns can represent the student's scores.\n",

    "You need to implement a method `calculateTotalScore` that takes a 2D array scores of integers representing player scores and returns the sum of all the elements in the array. Write the method signature and the method implementation. Include comments to explain your code."
