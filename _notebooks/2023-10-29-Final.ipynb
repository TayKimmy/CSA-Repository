There was also a constant CORS error that causes these issues. We also had a hard time figuring out the spacebook image upload as well as utilizing JWTs. We ultimately overcame the errors through constant teamwork and collaboration, and the spacebook image was helped through online resources like YouTube videos.\n",

    "4. Implement some sort of update functions for both leaderboards - maybe just for username\n",

    "\n",
    "Overall, I learned a lot. I had limited knowledge of Java before CSA, but after just one tri, I have learned how to create classes, methods, and constructors; define different data types; use different functions; and much more. I also learned to use Spring for the backend instead of Flask like CSP. \n",

    "### Accomplishments\n",
    "- Working on a Java Spring backend\n",
    "- Utilizing Javascript in the frontend\n",
    "- Integrating frontend and backend\n",
    "- Collaborating with groupmates\n",
    "\n",

    "### Lessons learned\n",
    "- I learned the importance of communication\n",
    "- There was several times when members weren't communicating about their commits\n",
    "    - Led to constant merge conflicts and a bit of frustration\n",
    "    - Also led to hour-long calls to resolve unexpected errors\n",
    "- Also learned importance of time management\n",

    "    - Often led to us sleeping at 2 am because we had to resolve these errors\n",

    "### Opportunities for Growth\n",
    "- Always communicate with team members\n",
    "- Make sure to consider errors and plan accordingly\n",
